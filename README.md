# Aigeon AI: Real-Time Image Search

## Project Description

Aigeon AI's Real-Time Image Search is a Python-based server application that provides real-time image search capabilities across the web. Utilizing the power of the RapidAPI platform, this application allows users to perform image searches with a variety of customizable filters, similar to those available in Google Images. This project is designed to offer a robust solution for retrieving images based on specific criteria, making it ideal for applications that require dynamic image search functionality.

## Features Overview

- **Real-Time Image Search**: Perform searches across the web to retrieve images in real-time.
- **Customizable Search Filters**: Utilize a wide range of filters to refine search results, including size, color, type, time, usage rights, file type, aspect ratio, and more.
- **Safe Search Options**: Control the visibility of explicit content in search results.
- **Regional Search Capabilities**: Specify the country or region for search queries to tailor results geographically.
- **Field Projection**: Select specific image fields to include in the response for optimized data retrieval.

## Main Features and Functionality

- **Search Images**: The core function `search_images` allows users to perform image searches with various filters. It supports parameters such as:
  - `query`: The search keyword or phrase.
  - `limit`: Maximum number of results to return.
  - `size`: Desired image size.
  - `color`: Dominant color of images.
  - `type`: Type of image (e.g., photo, clipart).
  - `time`: Time range for image updates.
  - `usage_rights`: Licensing and usage rights.
  - `file_type`: Image file format.
  - `aspect_ratio`: Aspect ratio of images.
  - `country`: Country of publication.
  - `safe_search`: Explicit content handling.
  - `region`: Region for query execution.
  - `fields`: Specific fields to include in the response.

## API Endpoints or Main Functions Description

### `search_images`

This function is the primary interface for performing image searches. It constructs a request to the RapidAPI endpoint with the specified parameters and returns the search results in JSON format. The function is decorated with `@mcp.tool()` to integrate with the FastMCP server framework.

## Configuration Parameters Explanation

- **RapidAPI Configuration**: The application uses a specific RapidAPI host and key for authentication. These are hardcoded in the script:
  - `x-rapidapi-host`: `real-time-image-search.p.rapidapi.com`
  - `x-rapidapi-key`: A placeholder key is used in the script. Replace it with a valid key from your RapidAPI account.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aigeon-ai.real-time-image-search.git
   cd aigeon-ai.real-time-image-search
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pydantic mcp
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Server**:
   Execute the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

2. **Perform Image Searches**:
   Use the `search_images` function to perform searches with desired parameters. Customize the search by providing appropriate arguments to the function.

## Requirements/Dependencies

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to the RapidAPI endpoint.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management.
- **MCP (FastMCP)**: A framework for building microservices, used to run the server.

Ensure that all dependencies are installed and configured correctly to enable seamless operation of the application.
